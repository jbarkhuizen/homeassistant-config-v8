"""A picture outlives the task it was made for.

Same-title reuse only ever looked at tasks that exist *right now*: tick off
"take out the bins", let the recurrence delete and recreate it, and the next
generation pays for the same picture again. This library remembers the
mapping from a task title to the picture it got, independently of any task,
so a title that came up before is answered from disk instead of the provider.

Two things make that safe rather than surprising:

* **Matching is conservative and local.** An exact match on the normalised
  title first; only then a near match, and only when the two titles differ in
  a single word, that word is not a number, and both the word overlap and the
  character similarity are high. No model is asked, nothing is guessed —
  "book a blood draw" finds "book a blood test", "milk 1l" does not find
  "milk 2l".
* **It is the shared pool, so it follows the same switch.** A list with
  `share_images` off neither reads from the library nor writes to it: three
  children with the same chore keep their own pictures, which is exactly what
  that switch is for.

The library is capped and evicts least-recently-used entries, deleting the
files they point at unless a task still uses them.
