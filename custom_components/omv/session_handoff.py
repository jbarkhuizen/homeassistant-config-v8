"""In-memory hand-off of an already-authenticated OMV session across a reload.

The config flow's ``reconfigure``/``reauth``/``user`` steps finish by asking
Home Assistant to (re)load the entry immediately (``async_update_reload_and_abort``
or the initial ``async_create_entry``). Without this hand-off, the following
``async_setup_entry`` call would open a brand new OMV login — and OMV always
challenges a *fresh* ``Session.login`` for two-factor accounts, even when one
was verified moments earlier and even though the same human isn't necessarily
watching for the immediate reload. Stashing the already-authenticated
:class:`~custom_components.omv.omv_api.OMVAPI` instance (and the
``system_info`` already fetched during the flow) lets the reload reuse that
live session instead of failing on a challenge nobody can answer.

Entries are keyed by hostname/unique_id rather than config-entry ID, since a
brand new entry does not have an entry ID yet at the point the flow finishes.
